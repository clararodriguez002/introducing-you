“Introducing First Name Last Name”
My name is Clara Rodíguez Jiménez and I live in Madrid, the capital city of Spain. But now I’m living in Ottawa for three months.
I was in a Middle School in Spain called “Colegio Caude”.
I have one brother called Javier who is 26 years old. My mum is 53 years old and she is called Cristina. My dad is called Juan Antonio and he is 57 years old. I love them too much,
I have the normal hobbies like going to the cinema, listening to music, being with friends… But the thing that I most enjoy doing is doing sports. I used to play tennis and now I play volleyball.
I like most if the types of music but I prefer pop or reggaeton.
I don’t have any favourite actor or actress but my favourite types of movie are horror films and comedy films.
I like all the food except of vegetables. My favourite food is the one that my mum and my grandma cook. I love Spanish food!
My strengths are sports and school and my weaknesses are missing my family and expressing my feelings.
I speak Spanish, English and a little bit of French.

This picture represents me because is the soccer team that I follow in Spanish and has all the values that I have.
On weeknights I like watching TV and being relaxed. At weekend I like going out with friends and watching TV series with my parents.
I want to learn a lot of things out of my experience in BTT10.
In Spain I usually use Windows and it’s good.
So, that are some things about me.
I hope you like it.
